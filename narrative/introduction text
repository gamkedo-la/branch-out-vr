Notes:
- I came up with the idea of writing a small introductory text before starting the game or tutorial.
- It could be a black screen with the introductory text and the following parameters:
  - Centered
  - It would be nice if the sentence/text “Take the chance” was a button with which the player could start the game. And when the player hovers over this button, it is underlined. 


Introduction Text:

All the bonsai trees have been wiped out by a natural disaster.

You were given a mission to learn how to restore natural order. 

Take the chance
